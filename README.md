### Ayo what's up?
My name is Rox. I'm a noob coder from Indonesia who want to be a pro B)

### What do I do? Well...
- I’m currently working on shaders for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition
- I’m currently learning Python and Java
- I don't have anyone I want to collaborate with. If you do, pls don't. I'm too lazy to collaborate.
- Ask me about OpenGL Shading Language, Lua, and HTML!
- Fun fact: Bali is not a country.
